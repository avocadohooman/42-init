first I went to /etc/ to see what files are in there. then I found the "hosts" entry and Google confirmed that this files contains the local DNS entries

cat /etc/hosts:

10.51.1.10       cdn.42.fr
10.51.1.10    cdn.intra.42.fr
127.0.0.1       localhost
255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
::1             localhost
